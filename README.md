I started this github repository on 20190403T0416Z.  See https://timestamps.glencooper.com for the format all of my timestamps use.

My intention of starting this repository was twofold;
1) learn how to use github pages.
2) Around the same time, I built a new subdomain; trust.glencooper.com.

This repository will be k̶i̶l̶l̶i̶n̶g̶ knocking out two birds with one stone.
